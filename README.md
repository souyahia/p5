# Samy's P5 Universe
Welcome to Samy's P5 Universe. This project is a React app that uses P5.js to render different sketches. React is used
in this project just to simplify the app creation process, and to render the home screen and the sketch control panels
more easily. The _fun_ part of this project comes from the sketches themselves.

This project is by no means intented to be published or reused anywhere in any way. This is simply a for-fun project,
that I created just for myself to make my life easier when I want to play with P5 and render some sketches. These
sketches can be anything, from physics simulations (chaotic double pendulum visualizations, particle trajectory
sims...) to algorithm visualizations (polygon intersections algorithms etc.) or math sims (mandelbrot set viz...). The
whole point of this project is to be able to create these kind of sketches as fast as possible and with minimal config
work in advance (even though I use TypeScript in the project... I know... I can't help myself...).

# Installation

```shell
yarn

You will be brought to a landing page with a collection of all the available sketches to choose from. Simply click on a
sketch to start playing with it.
